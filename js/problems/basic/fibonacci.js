// write a function that generates an array of fibonacci numbers
// the length of the array should be user selectable

// bonus: the function should let the user select fibonacci, tribonacci, etc..., as well as length
// bonus: make it recursive
// fib(11,2) would give [ 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55 ] (first 11 fib #'s)
// fib(11,3) would give [ 0, 1, 1, 2, 4, 7, 13, 24, 44, 81, 149 ] (first 11 trib #'s)
